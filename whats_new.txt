What's new?

=======================================================================
1)  RNA-Seq datasets that are reorganized to work with timefit package:
=======================================================================
    location: /cortex/data/RNA-Seq/human/brainspan/2014-11-05/
    datasets:
        brainspan2014exons_allGenes.mat - all of brainspan 2014 
        brainspan2014exons17pathways_allGenes.mat - only genes that belong to the 17 pathways
    The original datasets are also at the above location
    The matlab script that transforms the original datasets to the timefit version:
            /cortex/users/amir/scripts/adjust_brainspan_to_timefit.m
     
    notes:
    - When converted to timefit format, the whole brainspan RNA-Seq data exceeds 2GB. This means that it has to be saved
      in a compressed matlab format (7.3), which is currently not supported by timefit. Thus we currently need to work 
      with smaller sets, e.g the partial 17-pathways genes dataset above. 
    - exons are represented as intervals in the sequence, e.g. HTR_47407512_47409774
      the separator '_' can be changed - make sure to update the key 'exon_separator' in config.py
    - a detailed explanation about the data can be found at:

==========================    
2)  Exons-per-gene layout:
==========================
    There's a new hierarchical layout for the plots and the html, presenting exons per gene:
    ***sample 1: http://chechiklab.biu.ac.il/~amir/samples/timefit/exons_layout/fits.html
    The numbers in the cells are the min and max R-squared received for exons of that gene in that region.
    To use the new layout, run compute_fits with the flag --exons_layout. 
    Without the flag the standard layout is used, where each exon is treated as a separate gene:
    ***sample 2: http://chechiklab.biu.ac.il/~amir/samples/timefit/standard_layout/fits.html
    
=========================================
3)  New flags controlling exons plotting:
=========================================
    --exons_same_scale - sets the range of the y-axis to be the same for all exons per gene
    --plots_scaling - scaling to use on y axis (expression levels). Currently affects only exons plots. 
      the preferred scaling is log(x+1), default is 'none'
    --exons_plots_from_series - use the series plots (those under gene-region folder) to build the multi-exons plots. 
      Without this flag the data is plotted using a dedicated plotting method:
      ***sample 3 (without the flag): http://chechiklab.biu.ac.il/~amir/samples/timefit/exons_layout/exons_subplot/HTR2A/HTR2A-A1C.png
      ***sample 4 (with the flag): http://chechiklab.biu.ac.il/~amir/samples/timefit/exons_layout/exons_subplot_png/HTR2A/HTR2A-A1C.png
      note that currently only the dedicated method (without the flag) supports scaling and y axis alignment (first two flags above)
      
      Additional options:
      A gene can have more than 30 exons expressed in a single region - too much for showing them all on a single plot. 
      You can use split exons per gene over several plots. If splitted - dots will appear in each gene-region cell in the 
      main html,
      linking to the additional plots - See examples below.
      The config keys to control number of exons per figure
      exons_per_plot - number of exons when plotting using the dedicated plotting method (without --exons_plots_from_series)
      ***sample 5  http://chechiklab.biu.ac.il/~amir/samples/timefit/exons_multiplots/fits.html
      exons_per_series_plot - number of exons when plotting using the gene-region files (with --exons_plots_from_series)
      ***sample 6  http://chechiklab.biu.ac.il/~amir/samples/timefit/exons_multiplots/fits_series.html
      

=========================================      
4.  A new scaler has been added: log(x+1)
=========================================
    The string that represents it is log+1 (see second example below).

================================================================================================    
5. The gene-region plots are created in sub-folders per gene name rather than all in one folder.
================================================================================================

examples:
--------
python compute_fits.py --dataset brainspan2014exons17pathways --html ../../results --exons_layout --exons_plots_from_series
similar to sample 4

python compute_fits.py --dataset brainspan2014exons17pathways --html ../../results --exons_layout --plots_scaling log+1 --exons_same_scale
exons will be plotted using the dedicated method(like sample 3), but log scaled and with the same y axis range
